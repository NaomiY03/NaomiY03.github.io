        <p>“Why the pyramids were actually created by cats.” This interested me because I don’t understand why, but I know that the creation of the pyramids is a mystery for some reason. People seem to believe that they were created by aliens or something from a mystical force. I also know that cats were treated and worshipped as ‘gods’ back then so I thought that it would be funny if I tried to connect those two and make them somehow make some fictional sense.</p>
       <p>I also have a certain interest for ancient Egypt so I also wanted to take this opportunity to include some real-life events and mythological events to make it more interesting. I also own a cat and cats do a lot of climbing and plenty of more weird things that they shouldn’t even be able to, so why not try to make it seem like they were the reason behind one of earth’s most interesting and controversial topics? Also, cats are cool, funny, weird, and agile so why not create a whole topic about them?</p>

    <p>Ancient Egypt and their weird obsession with the idolization of cats. Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats because they believed they were magical, could bring good luck, and were sacred to the ‘gods’. They were also seen as vessels that the ‘gods’ chose to inhabit, and whose likeness ‘gods’ chose to adopt. Cats are often quick, strong, agile, and very stealthy, and during those days people worshipped anything they found interesting. From a statue to a wall painting or drawing.</p>
     
  <p>It could also be a secret society of cats that were apart from the ‘normal’ cats. The cats that built the pyramids would come out at night when the Egyptians were sleeping and they would plan how to build the pyramids day by day. Or they would supervise the Egyptians on how to build them. They would often host secret cat meetings to see who was going to go out on a certain night, where to get the materials, how long each cat would stay to build, which cats were to pose as distractions so that the humans wouldn’t notice, which cats would tell certain Egyptians to make it seem like the humans were the ones behind the whole thing, and which cats to not tell about their plans. I haven’t thought of a name for this secret cat organization but it would be funny if they were also the ones behind the paintings and drawings of the Egyptians building the pyramids.</p>
