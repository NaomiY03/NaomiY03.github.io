<p>One thing I can relate to Kate Wagner about is the nostalgia for certain websites and the technological interface of them back then. I remember back in the age of elementary school, we would get on these small boxy-like computers and play simple games. Before I discovered a website called ‘Cool Math Games’, there was a game called Purple Place that I absolutely loved playing. It was a game set in a grassy area with 3 buildings that you could choose to go into. Even sitting here and thinking of that game, it reminds me so much of how I would frequently ask my mom if I could use her laptop just to play it.</p>

<p>This doesn’t apply just to computer games but console games as well. I miss always bragging about playing the Wii, computer game Starfall, and Xbox Kinect games. Like Kate, I too witnessed the breakthrough and technological evolution of the technology of my era. What amazes me is that even though I never heard of My Space or even touched Facebook, millennials often get laughed at for constantly bringing them up or using them. But what my generation doesn’t realize is that we too have our “Facebook” and “Myspaces”. Before Tiktok it was Musical.ly. Before they had Instagram and WhatsApp, we had Oovoo, Vine, Kik, and Snapchat.</p>

<p>One of many things that caught my attention in this article is when Kate says, “Like many people my age and older, I miss the pre-social media internet. The new internet knows this, and it capitalizes on my nostalgia as it eats away at the old internet. It amounts to an unforeseen form of technological cannibalism.” Although I was born into a generation with so much social media, I too have a disapproval when it comes to social media sometimes. So I always reminisced about life when I was young, but old enough to remember the times before all these social apps went viral. I kind of wished that some social apps were never created because they spread so much hate and anger, but I always laughed at my mom and grandma for always being on Facebook and talking about it like it’s the greatest app in the world. But I never really sat back to think about how people older than me, who actually witnessed this technological evolution and how the web, before it became browsers, were like to them. Me laughing at my mom and grandma is similar to what Kate says about ‘the new internet knowing this and it capitalizes her nostalgia like an unforeseen form of technological cannibalism.’ So it is very interesting to hear someone older than me say that because I always thought people older than me never really cared about technology or were even afraid of it.</p>

<p>It is very fascinating to see the same and certain phrases that circulate the internet can be tied to different meanings in different eras. Kate states, “ There’s another gif with glitzy text that reads “Don’t hate me cuz I’m beautiful,” recalling the emotional trials of my Myspace days.” When I hear the words “Don’t hate me cuz I’m beautiful” it reminds me of a game called Grand Theft Auto where one of the main protagonist’s friends asks him if it’s okay to stay at his house. When the protagonist replies with a no, his friend says those exact words. He says much more but I’d rather not say it. That convo became a circulating meme and it still is today. It is cool and also eye-opening to see that even though we are born into different periods of technology we can still relate to one another in a way. After all, websites and social media help us to connect even if we’re thousands of miles away from one another.</p>
