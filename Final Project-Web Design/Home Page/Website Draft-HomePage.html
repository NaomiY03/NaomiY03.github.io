  <p> Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection
by the parasite called  Toxoplasma gondii, which can infect humans, animals, and birds. 
</p> 
  
  <p> Toxoplasmosis is originally a superpower that all cats have, well had, it was formally known as Toxoplasmeowsis
before scientist rebranded it to 
Toxoplasmosis.</p>  
    
  <p> Toxoplasmeowsis is a mind 
controlling power that cats
have. It allows them control
over any human or animal, 
and get them to do what they 
want.</p>  
    
 <p> Toxoplasmeowsis is also partially due to the reason of why cats were worshiped by Ancient Egyptians anyway. But it was mostly due to the fact that the Egyptians were weird but because they knew something we didn’t. Ancient Egyptians worshiped cats  because they believed they were magical, could bring good luck, and were sacred to the  ‘gods’. They were also seen as vessels that the ‘gods’ chose to inhabit, and whose likeness  ‘gods’ chose to adopt. Cats are often quick, strong, agile, and very stealthy. But Physically they aren’t very strong, so what better specimen to mind control that has the intellect and strength?</p>   
    
  <p> This is the story of the Miu  movement and how they  were responsible for the Pyramids.</p>
