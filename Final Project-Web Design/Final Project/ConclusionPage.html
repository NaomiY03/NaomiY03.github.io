  In conclusion, many might think that aliens were responsible for the Pyramids. Or the Egyptians  were ahead of their time when in reality the cats were responsible for it all. This knowledge has been lost in time but due to the fact that the cats were so secretive, but now we have a clear understanding as to why The Egyptians really worshiped cats. And if you donâ€™t know, now you know.
