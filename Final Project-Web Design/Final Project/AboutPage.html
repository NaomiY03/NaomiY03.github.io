 <p> “Miu”: Also the Egyptian word for cat, is the name of this secret cat society. The cats that  built the pyramids would come out at night when the Egyptians were sleeping and they would plan how to build the pyramids day by day and/or they would supervise the Egyptians on how to build them. They would often host secret cat meetings to see who was going to go out on a certain night, where to get the materials, how long each cat would stay to build, which cats were to pose as distractions so that the humans wouldn’t notice, which cats would tell certain Egyptians to make it seem like the humans  were the ones behind the whole thing, and which cats to not tell about their plans.</p> 
    
  <p> These cats would often meet up whether in the underground tunnels of the Pyramids, or the high tops. This is why they needed the Pyramids build, so that the humans did not know of there whereabouts and their secret powers. Any word of their magestic abilities being brought to light, would result in a severe punishment.</p>
