   <p> Cats were so loved that even after the ownerâ€™s had passed, or the cats themselves passed away. Their relationship would carry onto the after life. You may think that this is because of the love humans have for cats when in reality it is because of the spell and constant mind controlling of the Egyptians. They would control them so much that a remnant of their powers would linger in their minds.</p>

    <p> Cats were believed to be capable of bringing good luck to those who housed them. Showing further proof that those who were let into the Miu Movement had to earn the trust of the cats, and when they did they had a spiritual connection with the cat. So much as shaving off their eyebrows when the cat died.

    <p> Even now cats are great at keeping pests and rodents away. Back then they would maintain the cleanliness in homes by hunting rats and snakes, getting rid of any dangers in the homes of Egyptians. You may think this is the basic nature of cats but it was actually also physical training for the felines to fend off any potential danger that may approach the miu movement. It also kept the cats strong enough to move any object in case they needed to. It also maintained a normal cat facade.
